# âœ… Setup Script Now Works as Root!

## Changes Made

The `setup.sh` script has been updated to:
- âœ… **Allow root user** - No more blocking or warnings
- âœ… **Detect user automatically** - Works as root OR regular user
- âœ… **Use proper commands** - Automatically uses `sudo` only when needed
- âœ… **Adjust instructions** - Shows correct commands based on who's running it

## Run It Now!

### On Your VPS (as root):

```bash
cd /root/pintrest-downloader/deploy
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
1. Install Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, and Certbot
2. Clone your repository (if not already done)
3. Deploy containers
4. Configure Nginx
5. Setup firewall

### After It Completes:

```bash
# Setup SSL
certbot --nginx -d yttmp3.com -d www.yttmp3.com

# Verify
cd /var/www/pinterest-downloader
./deploy/verify.sh

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

## What Changed Technically

The script now:

```bash
# Detects if root
if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]; then
    SUDO=""  # No sudo needed
else
    SUDO="sudo"  # Use sudo for commands
fi

# Then uses $SUDO everywhere
$SUDO apt update
$SUDO systemctl restart nginx
# etc.
```

This way it works perfectly whether you're root or a regular user!

## All Commands Work As Root

- âœ… `apt update && apt upgrade`
- âœ… `docker compose build`
- âœ… `docker compose up`
- âœ… `nginx -t && systemctl restart nginx`
- âœ… `ufw allow` and firewall setup
- âœ… File permissions and ownership

No more warnings or errors! ðŸŽ‰
